Here are **clear, step-by-step lab procedures** for both questions — one for **GnuPG (secure storage, transmission, and digital signature)** and one for **Snort (NIDS)**.
These steps follow the exact format used in academic practicals — easy to write in your record or demonstrate during a lab viva.

---

## 🧩 **Experiment 1 — Secure Storage, Transmission, and Digital Signature (GnuPG)**

### 🎯 **Aim:**

To securely store and transmit data using **encryption** and **digital signatures**, and to verify the signature after transmission — demonstrating **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authenticity**.

---

### ⚙️ **Tools / Concepts Used:**

* **GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** — command-line encryption/signing tool.
* **RSA Algorithm** — for public-key cryptography.
* **SHA-256** — for generating message hash for signatures.

---

### 🧭 **Step-by-Step Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Install GnuPG**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnupg -y
```

---

#### **Step 2: Generate Key Pair**

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

* Choose RSA and RSA
* Key size: 2048 or 4096 bits
* Enter name, email, and passphrase
* This creates your public and private keys.
  Check your key:

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

---

#### **Step 3: Create a File to Encrypt**

```bash
echo "Confidential project report: Do not share." > report.txt
```

---

#### **Step 4: Encrypt the File (Confidentiality)**

To send securely to another user (e.g., *Bob*):

```bash
gpg --output report.txt.gpg --encrypt --recipient "Bob"
```

File `report.txt.gpg` is now encrypted — only Bob can decrypt it using his private key.

---

#### **Step 5: Decrypt the File (Receiver side)**

Bob decrypts using:

```bash
gpg --output decrypted.txt --decrypt report.txt.gpg
```

---

#### **Step 6: Create a Digital Signature (Integrity + Authenticity)**

Sender (Alice) signs the file:

```bash
gpg --output report.sig --detach-sign report.txt
```

This produces `report.sig` — a separate signature file.

---

#### **Step 7: Verify the Signature (Receiver side)**

Bob verifies:

```bash
gpg --verify report.sig report.txt
```

If the message shows `Good signature from Alice`, then:

* The file is unaltered (integrity).
* The sender is authentic (authenticity).

---

#### **Step 8: Combine Signing and Encryption**

For both confidentiality and authenticity in one command:

```bash
gpg --output secure_report.asc --armor --encrypt --sign --recipient "Bob" report.txt
```

Bob decrypts and verifies automatically:

```bash
gpg --decrypt secure_report.asc
```

---

### 🧾 **Expected Output:**

```
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID XXXXXXXX
gpg: Good signature from "Alice"
Confidential project report: Do not share.
```

---

### ✅ **Result:**

Data was **encrypted**, **digitally signed**, and **successfully verified** after transmission using GnuPG.

---

## 🧩 **Experiment 2 — Configure and Use Snort as a NIDS**

### 🎯 **Aim:**

To configure and use **Snort** as a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**, monitor real-time network traffic, apply rules, and analyze logs for potential intrusions.

---

### ⚙️ **Tools / Concepts Used:**

* **Snort** — Open-source NIDS tool.
* **ICMP (ping)** and **TCP SYN** traffic — to simulate suspicious packets.
* **Snort rules** — detection logic for suspicious activities.

---

### 🧭 **Step-by-Step Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Install Snort**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort -y
```

When prompted, enter your local network (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

Check version:

```bash
snort -V
```

---

#### **Step 2: Configure Network and Paths**

Open configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

Set:

```
var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
var EXTERNAL_NET any
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
```

---

#### **Step 3: Add Custom Detection Rules**

Edit local rules file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```

Add:

```
# Detect ICMP echo requests (ping)
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; itype:8; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

# Detect suspicious TCP SYN packets on port 22
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"Possible SSH Scan"; flags:S; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

Save and exit.

---

#### **Step 4: Test Configuration**

```bash
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

✅ “Snort successfully validated configuration!” means no syntax errors.

---

#### **Step 5: Run Snort in IDS Mode**

```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

Now Snort is listening for traffic.

---

#### **Step 6: Generate Test Traffic**

Open another terminal and run:

```bash
ping -c 2 192.168.1.5
```

or

```bash
sudo hping3 -S -p 22 -c 1 192.168.1.5
```

These will trigger the rules.

---

#### **Step 7: Check Alerts**

Check console or alert file:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
```

Expected alerts:

```
[**] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**]
[**] [1:1000002:1] Possible SSH Scan [**]
```

---

#### **Step 8: Analyze Logs**

Alerts are stored in:

```
/var/log/snort/alert
```

Each entry includes:

* Timestamp
* Source IP
* Destination IP
* Triggered rule ID and message

---

### ✅ **Result:**

Snort successfully captured and identified suspicious network traffic (ICMP ping and SSH scan) using custom detection rules.

---

## 🧾 **Summary Table**

| Part  | Tool  | Concept          | Demonstrated Outcome                     |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **1** | GnuPG | Cryptography     | Secure encryption, signing, verification |
| **2** | Snort | Network Security | Real-time intrusion detection & logging  |

---

### 🧠 **In Simple Words**

* **GnuPG part:** Shows how to protect and verify data during communication.
* **Snort part:** Shows how to monitor network packets and detect suspicious behavior.
